- Extend my_list with another list: [50, 60, 70].
- Remove the last element from my_list.
- Sort my_list in ascending order.
- Find and print the index of the value 30 in my_list.

WEEK 3 ASSIGNMENT
Create a function named calculate_discount(price, discount_percent) that calculates the final price after applying a discount. The function should take the original price (price) and the discount percentage (discount_percent) as parameters.

Use constructors to initialize each object with unique values.
Add an inheritance layer to explore polymorphism or encapsulation.
Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge! 🎭
